## 📖 About the Project
**Basix (BigOnezBrand)** is a full-stack web application I developed to showcase Morocco’s first biodegradable clothing brand.  

This project is both:

- A **portfolio case study** demonstrating my full-stack web development and branding skills  

The platform communicates **Basix’s mission**: pioneering eco-friendly fashion with 100% biodegradable, skin-safe, and sustainable materials.
